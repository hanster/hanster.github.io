title: Focusing all day
---

It can be difficult to focus for long periods of time. 
At times if you're working on a hard problem after a few hours you can find yourself just staring at the screen unable to concentrate.

## Focus mana

In the Time Management chapter of [The Clean Coder][1], Uncle Bob mentions that focus is a limited resources and likens it to mana. 
This gets depleted during the day and I'm sure everyone has felt an empty focus-mana pool before.
So how do we keep this topped up?

## The Pomodoro Technique

One possible way is taking regular breaks. The [Pomodoro Technique][2] involves setting a timer for 25 minutes. During this period you focus on your work and block out any outside distractions. E-mails, internet, maybe even collegues.
If someone needs to ask you a question or needs you for something, it's rare they will be unable to wait till the timer runs out. 
After the timer is up, you deal with any distractions that might have occured and then take a 5 minute break. 
This is repeated and after every forth 25 minute burst you take a 30 minute break.

## Regaining that focus

We have plenty of options for what to do during a break. A foosball table, sets of juggling balls, we even make fresh coffee to recharge.


All in all, sometimes you need to take a step away from the computer and refill that focus mana.
