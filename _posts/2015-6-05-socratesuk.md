title: SoCraTes UK 2015

Excellent first conference. Actually it was an un-conference as the attendees where the ones providing the content in the many multiple open areas.
There were many interesting sessions / workshops but as the sessions run concurrently you have to make a trade off on what you have to miss out on.

There were lightning talks on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evening. Some excellent talks as indicated on the SoCraTesUK wiki page.
I particularly liked the follow talks:

### Characterisation Testing by Georgina [@gemcfadyen][1]
This was showed you an interesting way to learn about a system that you are new to. You write a failing test to see how the system behaves and then edit the test to make it pass.
You will learn about the behaviour and have tests in place for when you need to do any changes to the code.
There might be times when you spot a bug so the Characterisation tests shouldn't be the only thing you use to learn about a system and should just be another tool in your belt.

### Mutation testing By Vincenc [@vgaltes][2]
This was about editing your code in a way that should cause your tests to fail, indicating your tests are testing the right things. It is also an indicator of the quality of your tests.

### Mindful Pairing By Mash [@mashooq][3]
Mash discussed how pairing should be a mindful practice.
Sometimes you need to do some loose pairing in which the pair will sometimes diverge and do some coding / thinking alone and then converge back and to discuss and what they have found out and what they can do for the next pairing session.
Other topics he covered included the making the set up station as comfortable as possible and making sure the pair focus on their individual roles in the session.

### Finding the Biting point in Pairing By Amir [@amirbazazi][4]
A talk by one of the Apprentices at Codurance. Here Amir makes a comparison to the biting point of a manual geared car and how you can explain the biting point for as long as you want but you need to experience what the biting point feels like to actually understand.

Sometimes a junior developer can be in the passenger seat for too long and will not gain as much value from pairing as they would in the driving seat. Amir gave us some advice on what senior and junior developers can do to improve the pairing session.
Seniors should encourage the junior to pair more and take an active role in the sessions and the junior should give the senior developer a nudge so they can do more coding.

## More to come ...
There were many more talks I enjoyed and I will be posting up another post to talk about more of the lightning talks, sessions and discussions I had during the event.
