First week completed, what has happened, what have I done, what have I learned?


So I have completed my first full week at 8th Light. Well my first day started last Tuesday so it's a full week now I've come to the end of Monday.

## The people

Everyone at 8th Light is very friendly and welcoming. Each day we greet each and every co-worker  with a handshake (or the occasional fist bump).
At the end of the day we also say our goodbyes with a handshake (slash fist bump).
I found this [article][1] by an 8th Light craftsman dating back from 2007. This long standing tradition may be a small gesture but you can definitely tell it helps keep the team close.
Another small thing is also going out to grab lunch together and sit around chatting while we eat. It's nice to have a friendly team to work within.


My co-mentors, Jim and Nathan, have been quite busy this week. Jim, being in the US for work and on holiday, and Nathan, working on-site with a client.
This doesn't mean I haven't had any guidance. Jim has taken the time to prep me over Skype on my first day, detailing what to expect from the apprenticeship and showing me a list of tasks to get me started on.
Nathan was checking daily to see how I was going and if I had any problems, even though he is understandably busy on-site.
There are also the other craftsmen and apprentices in the office who are ready to help, you just need to shout or post on slack and someone is always willing to lend a hand.


## Learning a new language and Vim

Ruby is a language I have only really glanced at. I have done some exercises from the Rspec book but not gone into any depth. 
So one of my user stories was to start with the [Ruby Koans][2]. I did find them quite useful but it did seem to be fairly long. As detailed in my [first post][3], I was a bit frustrated with the slow feedback until I used guard-shell to get the test to automatically run after making changes to the koans.
There was also the problem of learning Vim at the same time. But I am slowly building a Vim / Tmux set up with the help of other 8th Light craftsmen and apprentices.

Once I completed the Koans I got started on doing the Roman Numerals kata. I remember watching a very nice [demonstration][4] by the late Jim Weirich so had a rough idea it eventually refactors down to looping through a hash map.


## Next steps

[8th Light University][5] (8LU) happens every Friday lunch time. It's a lunch and learn event where a few people from 8th Light will present a topic or demonstrate something they have been working on or that they are interested in. This give the craftsman or apprentice the chance to practice performing.
This coming Friday I have volunteered (/been volunteered) to perform the Roman Numerals kata. 
This will give me something to focus on and really push me to improve my Vim skills. It will also allow me to gain feedback from craftsmen and apprentices on how I could improve my performance for next time. 
I think this experience will be similar to when I competed in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. After competing, you always know there is a weak area that you can focus on for next time and how testing yourself is also one of the best ways to improve.

So for the next week I will be focusing on improving my Vim / Tmux / Ruby workflow while also starting on the Mastermind story.

So far so good.
