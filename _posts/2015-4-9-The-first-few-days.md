title: My first few days at 8th Light
---

For the next 6 months I'll be starting on the road to becoming a software craftsman.
This post will be the first of many documenting my thoughts and experiences during the journey.

After a meeting with Jim, one of my mentors, it was clear that one of the goals of the apprenticeship is the act of practice. "Practise makes Perfect", this isn't quite true, practise makes permanent.
In this case the practice I will be doing as part of the apprenticeship will be guided and so I will be improving as time goes on.
I will practise blogging, coding and performing. My mentors and peers will give me feedback so the next time I practise I can improve on my previous performance.
Hopefully throughout my apprenticeship this blog will show how much improvement practise makes.

The apprenticeship will also be more of a self driven / guided with the mentors being on hand to provide feedback and guidance when needed.
This means I will need to focus on self assessment and identify areas what I am weak in and where I want to improve.


Jim mentioned that Ruby will be one of the languages I will learning during my apprenticeship. 
Artisan, an internally developed project, is used to manage the backlog of stories, so there were a few stories related to Ruby ready for me to get started on.
One of the first tasks was to complete the Ruby Koans.
As I heard Vim was one of the tools used by many at 8th Light, it seemed the obvious choice.
I have some basic knowledge of Vim, helped by one of the courses on [memrise][1], so making edits to the files wasn't too difficult.
A slow point I found was getting feedback on whether I had completed one of the Koans. I was originally running the following command after each edit to get feedback: 

```bash
ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb
```

This wasn't ideal so after searching around I found an useful [article][2] about setting up guard-shell so that a task is run when any files are changed in the koans folder.
Instant feedback achieved!


The apprenticeship will be a challenging and difficult journey, but with practise I will improve week by week and slowly become more of a software craftsman.
