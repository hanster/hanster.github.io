Following on from my first SoCraTes post, I will continue with the some of the other Lightning talks I found interesting.

### Naming Things By Gill [@lurst][1]
Some key points from the talk:

  *  Avoid complexity
  * Aim for: Readability, ease of understanding and ease of maintainability
  * If you can't name it, it means you don't understand it and you might need to do some rubber duck debugging to clarify your understanding.
  * If the name is long and is doing too much -> you need to refactor.
  * Use a thesaurus or even use Google to help you name it better.
  * Names to avoid: do_stuff -> this has no meaning. Inconsistant naming, i.e. using both view and then display when talking about the same thing. Names that are too big. Abbreviations should be avoided.
  

### Impact Mapping By Sandro Mancuso [@sandromancuso][2]
Sandro discussed using Impact Mapping to help extract the domain language and the features that the client wants to develop.
The Why, Who and How are discussed. The Why is the core goal of the business. The Who indicates the actors that can help achieve the goal. And the How is what needs to be done to help the people in the Who category.
A session was also ran on this topic where Sandro expanded on this idea. He indicated that in a 2 day workshop with the client they created a mind map and just shouted out ideas which were instantly added to the map.
The discussion went on and the domain language slowly appeared. This led to grouping features and discovering the Bounded Contexts.

## Summary

Overall I found my first SoCraTes to be awesome. The lightning talks and sessions inspired me to think about functional programming, different types of testing, the values of developers, continuous integration and deployment and many more topics.
I had some interesting chats with some of the attendees about their experiences with the software craftsmanship community and also about their experiences with working in different types of organizations.
I intend to attend more LSCC events in the future and to carry on learning all about craftsmanship in the future.
