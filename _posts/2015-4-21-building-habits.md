title: Building habits

There are [plenty][1] of good articles about how to build a habit.
A quick google search of `building habits` yields 138,000,000 results!
This isn't another how to post on building habits, but more of an accountability post to force me to build good habits!

## Key points

### Start small

Many articles state that you should start small when building a habit.
In the case of trying to blog daily, this could mean just writing a really short post. Anything small to keep that habit going!

### Build a chain

Using a habit tracker such as [Joe's Goals][2] can help keep the motivation up.
As the chain gets bigger and bigger, you will want to keep that habit up just to preserve the chain.

### You will break the chain

Life will get in the way. You might get sick, be snowed under at work, have a family emergency or even win the lottery!
You have to accept that you will miss a day or two. It's how you deal with the next day.
If you miss a day, no big deal, aim to keep it going the next day.
Missing two days in a row and things start to go down hill real fast. You will start to feel indifferent towards carrying on the habit.
If this is the case you need to go right back and `start small` again. This will hopefully reboot that habit.

### Just do it

Most people think it's motivation that is stopping them from building good habits.
I think it's actually discipline.
You just need to start that first bit. Open the text editor and write the title. 
Put your running shoes on and just step out the door.
You just need to do it even when you're not motivated.


So with those points, I'm hoping I'll be able to keep up with the habit of daily blogging.
