title: Mastery Cohort
---

Micah Martin came over from the US for a week as part of the mastery cohort.
Mastery cohorts are lead by master craftsmen who take a day out every quarter to inspire and guide us on our software craftsman journey.

Micah had a whole day of activities for us to do on the Friday.

At the start of the week he assigned us homework of practicing a kata, 10 minutes in the morning and again in the evening. 
We then performed the kata live with a 8 minute time limit. I was a bit over, needing a littlbe bit more refining to get under the limit.

The other activities for the day were a surprise.
He told us about the importance of design patterns. A natural next step from the SOLID principles.

Task of choosing from a list of design patterns and spending 30 minutes to prepare an 8 min presentation.

Being the newest hire I got first choice. Adapter and facade patterns.

My presentation was involved giving a real world example. At the office we always greet each other in the morning.
Most people handshake, a few fist bump. I made comparisons that the adapter pattern helps 2 differing interfaces communicate.
Facade - something complicated is made simple. Again a real world example making coffee, which involves checking we have coffee beans, weighing, grinding, measuring the water etc. Have an apprentice.make_coffee method instead.
This hides all the unnecessary interface as all we want is a cup of coffee.

Another task involved spending 45 minutes researching a topic and writing a blog post for someone else to read out.

The interesting things about the time constraints is that it's hard. You think 'how am I going to do all the work in time'. But there Parkinson's law states 'work expands so as to fill the available for its completion'. 

I personally found the exercises a great way of learning, forcing you to pick key information out and summarising as best as you can.
