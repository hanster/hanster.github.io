title: Code Katas
---

The idea of code katas gained popularity through Dave Thomas, co-author of *The Pragmatic Programmer*.
This [article][1] describes how he came up with the idea one day while taking his son to a karate lesson. 

## But what is a code kata?

A code kata is a short exercise, 30 minutes up to an hour (though some people even do exercises that are under 10 minutes), in which a software developer does deliberate practice.
In martial arts, katas are a way for students to practice a series of set moves over and over in order to refine their skills.
Since software developers rarely have / make time to do any deliberate practice, the idea of code katas came about.

## How can they help?

In order to make the most out of code katas, and actually in most things, you need to review and get feedback on what you have done.
Recording your code kata can be one way.
As you review your kata, you may find one section of your practice tedious, this can lead you to looking up a better way to do it and in doing so find out a shortcut sequence or a plug-in that improves your efficiency.

Code katas are also not just about solving the problem.
They can also be used to warm up for the day and get you into the programming mood.
Just pick a kata you have already done and let your fingers loosen up and start getting your brain into gear for the day ahead.

There are also times at 8th Light when someone will perform a kata in front of all the developers. This can help both spectators and the performer.
The spectators might see a shortcut or work flow that they've never seen before and the performer will have to make sure they have practiced enough in order to make the performance enjoyable to the crowd.

## Resources

There are now many resources online for practising code katas.

[Code wars][2] - a website with hundreds of different code katas in multiple languages including Python, Ruby, Java and even Clojure and Haskell.

[4clojure][3] - a website with exercises in clojure

[Ruby Quiz][4] - Over a hundred puzzles that were published every week and then the solutions were collated and reviewed by the site owner.
