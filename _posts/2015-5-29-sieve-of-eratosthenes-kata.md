title: Sieve of Eratosthenes Kata in Ruby
---

Practicing a kata was one of the tasks that Micah gave us as part of his visit.

I choose to do the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Ruby and found I my performance was around 10 mins during the mastery cohort day.

After a bit more practice I was able to smooth out the kata and get it to just under 6 minutes.

Here it is on youtube:
