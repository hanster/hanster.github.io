title: Professionalism - The Clean Coder

What does it mean to be a professional software developer?

In the first chapter of [The Clean Coder][1], Uncle Bob explains what professionalism means to him.

Professionals will take responsibility and be held accountable for their actions.

Uncle Bob mentions that professionals will can do this by doing two things:

* First, do no harm
* Work ethic

### First, do no harm
Here a professional should ensure they deliver working software without bugs. 
How do we do this? Uncle Bob states we can't be perfect but we should learn from our errors and as we mature it is our responsibility to get your error rate closer and closer to zero.

Another point in *First, do no harm*, is that *QA should find nothing*. Code you send to QA should not be faulty. Uncle Bob states that any code you are uncertain about is faulty code!
So what is uncertain code? Any code that is not under tests! Uncle Bob states we should aim for 100% code coverage to make sure you are certain the code works!

*Do no harm to structure* covers how even if your code works, your code should be structured in a flexible and maintainable manner. 
The software should be easy to change, and the only way to prove that this is the case is to make changes!
`If you want your software to be flexible, you have to flex it!`

### Work Ethic
`Your career is your responsibility`

Uncle Bob explains that as a professional, you need to put in an extra 20 hours on top of your 40 hour work week on reading, practicing, learning and enhancing your career.

These 20 hours are used so that your are constantly improving and learning more about your chosen field. Your daily job is a performance so you need to spend time practicing in an environment where you can make mistakes.

The last section covers humility. There is an interesting [blog post][2] by one of the 8th Light craftsmen. It covers how you have to be humble while on your journey towards becoming a software craftsman.

During the apprenticeship there will be times when I will get feedback that may seem harsh. The thing I have to remember is that these remarks will not be personnel. 
The feedback is to help me improve my code and my performance for next time.
Humility is needed in order to take this feedback and use it as fuel to keep moving forward and get slowly get better with time.
