The purpose of this blog is to keep track of my progress and to aid my learning during the 8th Light appreticeship. 
Blogging daily is one of the tasks Jim has set. I am fairly new to blogging and writing in general so I have looked into a few articles about how to structure a blog post.

## Structure
One [article][1] suggested using [Freytag's pyramid][2], also known as dramatic structure, as a basis for blog posts.

The article mentions using the 5 steps of the pyramid:

1. Introduction
2. Rising Action
3. Climax
4. Falling Action
5. Resolution (and call to action)

Since I'm a newbie to the whole blogging thing, I'll use the 3 step the article suggests instead:

1. Here's my idea
2. Here's my data
3. Here are my solutions

## Daily practise
Aiming for a daily blog post as a form of daily practise, my understanding of how to apply this structure will improve and my future blog posts will get better and better. As I improve and get more confident in writing, I will start using the 5 step structure, but for now my posts will be short and follow the 3 step structure.
